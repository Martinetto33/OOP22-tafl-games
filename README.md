# Tafl Games

The heart of this project is the <b>"Hnefatafl"</b> game, one of a family of ancient Northern European board games that goes under the name of Tafl Games.
<br>There are two different game modes:
<ul>
    <li>
        the <b>classic mode</b>, that reproduces the original version of Hnefatafl;
    </li>
    <li>
        the <b>variant mode</b>, that presents some new features of our invention.
    </li>
</ul>

This project has been realized for the Object-Oriented Programming course of the Bachelor's degree in Computer Science and Engineering at University of Bologna, Cesena Campus.
