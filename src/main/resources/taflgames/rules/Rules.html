        <h1>RULES</h1>
        <h2>Classic Mode</h2>

            [TO DO]
        </p>
        <h2>Variant Mode</h2>
        <p>
            Compared to the classic version of the game, the variant version of the game offers
            four types of special pieces and one type of special cell.
            <ul>
                <li>
                    The <b>Queen</b> is able to bring killed allied pieces back to the game, by moving to a cell
                    that is adjacent to another cell on which an allied piece has been killed.
                </li>
                <li>
                    The <b>Archer</b> can take part to the killing of an opponent's piece, by moving on
                    the same row or column of that opponent's piece.
                </li>
                <li>
                    The <b>Shield</b> is a piece that can survive to a killing once.
                </li>
                <li>
                    The <b>Swapper</b> can swap its position with one of the opponent's pieces,
                    apart from the King.
                </li>
                <li>
                    The <b>Slider</b> cell makes the piece that lands on it slide in the furthest
                    reachable position in the direction shown on the cell. These special cells appear and
                    disappear periodically every few turns, changing the direction of the sliding each time.
                </li>
            </ul>
        </p>
